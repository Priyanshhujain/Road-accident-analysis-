# Road Accident Analysis Using Power BI

This project aims to analyze road accidents and create a **Power BI Dashboard** to provide insights into accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard is designed to help identify key performance indicators (KPIs), visualize trends, and provide insights to assist in improving road safety measures.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a **Power BI dashboard** for road accident data from 2021 and 2022. The dashboard will present meaningful insights such as accident severity, trends over time, and other key factors influencing road safety. The analysis is expected to help in understanding accident patterns, identifying high-risk areas, and improving decision-making for safety measures.

### Steps Involved
1. **Requirement Gathering**: Understand the clientâ€™s requirement for the Road Accident Dashboard for 2021-2022.
2. **Data Overview**: Explore the dataset to get a basic understanding of the data.
3. **Connecting Data with Power BI**: Import the dataset into Power BI for further analysis.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.
5. **Data Modeling**: Prepare the data by creating relationships between tables, if necessary.
6. **Background Design**: Create a dashboard background using PowerPoint to ensure an intuitive design.
7. **Data Visualization**: Use various charts and graphs to represent the KPIs and insights from the data.
8. **Dashboard Building**: Design an interactive dashboard that includes filters and slicers for user-friendly exploration.
9. **Insight Generation**: Provide insights that reflect accident patterns, trends, and key factors contributing to road accidents.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs and insights are identified for this analysis:
- **Accident Severity Distribution**: Breakdown of accidents by severity (minor, serious, or fatal).
- **Number of Accidents Over Time**: Trend analysis of the total number of accidents by month.
- **Accidents by Day of the Week**: Distribution of accidents by days to identify high-risk days.
- **Top Junctions Contributing to Accidents**: Junctions with the highest number of accidents.
- **Weather Conditions and Road Surface Conditions**: Correlation between weather, road conditions, and accident severity.

## Insights from the Analysis
- **Total Incidents**: 144,400 traffic accidents occurred in the current year, with a decrease of 11.7% compared to the previous year.
- **Serious Injuries**: Most accidents resulted in minor injuries, while deaths decreased by 35.6% compared to last year.
- **Causalities by Light Condition**: 73.84% of accidents happened during the day in the current year, slightly higher than the previous year (72.22%).
- **Causalities by Vehicle Type**: Cars had the highest involvement in accidents, followed by bikes and vans.
- **Causalities by Area**: 61.95% of the accidents occurred in urban areas, compared to 60.44% in the previous year.
- **Causalities by Month**: Peak accident months include October and November.
- **Causalities by Road Type**: Single carriageways were involved in the majority of accidents.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Import Dataset**: Load the dataset containing road accident data for 2021 and 2022 into Power BI.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle any missing or inconsistent data, ensuring it is ready for analysis.
3. **Dashboard Design**: Use Power BI to design the dashboard with interactive visualizations, charts, and graphs.
4. **Explore the Dashboard**: Use the interactive dashboard to explore insights by filtering through different parameters (time, accident severity, vehicle type, etc.).

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **PowerPoint**: For background design in the dashboard.
- **Excel/CSV**: Dataset format for importing into Power BI.

## Future Improvements
- Include more detailed geographic visualizations (maps) to locate high-risk accident areas.
- Add predictive analytics to forecast accident trends for future years.
- Expand the dataset to include more years for a more comprehensive analysis.
